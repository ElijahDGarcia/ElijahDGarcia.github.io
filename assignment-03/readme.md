#Browsers
Browsers function as interpreters, essentially. They interpret data from host
servers and display them in the typical way we see using HTML and Javascript
interpreters. Back in the day, you used to need stuff like Flash and Shockwave
installed for cool stuff like games and videos, but now that's all integrated
with HTML5.
I currently use Chrome, and Opera if I need to do any seeding.

A Markup language is one that interprets text in an easy way that's read by a
person on a computer. HTML is an example.
