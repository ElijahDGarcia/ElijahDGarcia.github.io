#How is the web different than the internet?
The Web is how information connects, the internet is how people (or servers)
connect. The internet is the physical connection of all the servers and devices
communicating with one another. The web is a person-friendly interpretation
of the information held within connected in a way that makes it easier to find
related information elsewhere.
Briefly describe how the internet works. ("Magic.")
The internet is a 'cable', which connects servers to one another. These servers
connect to other servers, which connect to various devices and routers along the
way. Essentially, the internet works by allowing every device to communicate
with every other device that's connected to the larger network, in a way that
ignores hardware and software differences (like Macs and Windows and Linux
operating systems) in a uniform way. Utilizing packets of information, it allows
computer to exchange data.
What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
A directory is a 'tree' of files and folders. A directory organizes files however
a human wishes them to be organized, and SHOULD be used in such a way that it's
easier for other humans to travel down the directory to find what they need.
They are also used by computers to store files and folders in a descending order,
So that a parent file can easily find and manipulate a child file.
Why is using a VCS beneficial?
It can help you undo changes, find bugs, and document what was done much more easily
by taking 'snapshots' of versions of your projects at various times.
State at least one thing you found interesting this topic, or that you didn't know before.
I didn't know how packets are used to keep information going where it needs to go.
I've heard the term before, but that's about it.
